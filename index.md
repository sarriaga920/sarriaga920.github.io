As a lecturer at MSU Denver, I teach courses in geography, GIS, climate change, indigenous geographies, urban geography, and transportation planning. My research interests include transportation planning and geography through the lens of sustainability. I recently began working on two interesting research projects with my students and colleagues. The first is a study on the transportation experiences of people in the blind and low vision community, specifically looking at their use of rideshare technologies. Second, I am working on a study analyzing where to locate new electric vehicle charging stations in Colorado by utilizing machine learning and programming to model electric vehicle failure rates. My favorite part of my job is working with students on research projects that they are passionate about and seeing them succeed in their educational and career goals.

This is my third summer working with the Earthlab Earth Data Science program. In 2021, our team of interns researched the impacts of COVID and wildfires on air quality in the Denver Metro region. Here is a link to that research [Air Quality Data and Transportation-Related Emissions](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/blog/air-quality-data-and-transportation-related-emissions). In 2023, our team worked on water quality on the Dine reservation. 

I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee but I've lived in Colorado for over 15 years. I enjoy skiing, hiking, dancing, and becoming a swim and dive team mom most recently! I also love watching all things Broncos and Nuggets. I enjoy working with the ESIIL Stars program and seeing the students become more confident in their technical skills and learning new programming skills. The passion that the interns have for their work and research topics always fuels and excites me. It is a wonderful program for our students and faculty.
